Hide your number through your device's settings. Many phones allow you to block your Caller ID information by changing the phone's settings. If your phone does not have the option to do this, then it is not allowed by your carrier, and you will have to try one of the previous steps.
iPhone - Open the Settings app, tap Phone, tap Show My Caller ID, and then toggle the slider to ON.[1]
Android 4.0 and earlier - Open the Settings app, tap Call, tap "Additional settings", tap Caller ID, and then tap "Hide number".
Android 4.1 and later - Open the Phone app, tap the Menu button, tap "Call settings", tap Caller ID, tap "Hide number".[2]
Windows Phone 8 - Open the Phone app, tap the More button (...), tap "settings", tap the box under "Show my caller ID to", tap "no one" or "my contacts".[3]
BlackBerry - Press the Menu key, click Options, click General Options, find the Restrict My Identity field, set it to Always.
